I have only been to Second City in Chicago so I have to compare this to that.  I liked Second City better because it was funnier and had a better vibe.  I did enjoy myself at the N Crowd and so didn't the people I went with.  One of us even got pulled on stage.  I thought some scenes were not funny but that's how improv goes, you win some, you lose some.  But overall, I thought they did a great job and you can tell they really enjoyed what they were doing.

Ugh....got some bad mussels in one of the seafood dishes.  Bad as in got pretty sick afterwards.  Maybe I should have known, but so shouldn't they.  If it ain't fresh, don't serve it.  I knew from the first one I ate.  Didn't touch them after that thank God.	Ugh....got some bad mussels in one of the seafood dishes.  Bad as in got pretty sick afterwards.

I have been to this location a few times and food is always good.  We were at this location with a group of friends and were served in the beautiful enclosed lanai.  My only grief is the service.  RC is considered fine dining, if I am not mistaken - or at least at the prices it should be.  Another consideration is that considering our large party the gratuity is already built in so why try so hard?  The gentleman refilling water glasses and reaching over patron's heads?  slow service, not picking up and placing orders properly - maybe I am just nit picky but at these prices I believe not only should the food be impeccable but so shouldn't the service.

Great food but over priced; but so aren't most of the local eateries in the French Quarter.  Average meal for 2 people costs a little over $100.

Went here while it was gusting winds and rain outside (it was a rough trek there). The restaurant is small but cozy and very colorful. The food is above average for sure but so aren't the prices.

For the people living in the Nile Basin,the river is their life. This 6,825 km waterway,whose watershed covers three million square kilometers,flows through mountains,woodlands,lakes and deserts. Its potential for fishing,tourism and shipping is great-but so aren't its challenges.\nWater shortage,already serious in Egypt and Sudan,will soon influence several other countries in the watershed as well. Today,about 160 million people depend on the Nile River for their living. Within the next 25 years,the district's population is expected to double,adding to the demand brought about by growth in industry and agriculture. The frequent drought adds to the urgency.\nWater quality is also a problem. Precious soil is washed out to sea. Half the Nile Basin's countries are among the world's poorest nations; yet,somehow,they must find the resources,skills and political will to overcome these challenges.

For five days, Edmonton's Downtown Park is transformed into one huge stage where artists are able to share their talents, and where people are able to celebrate and enjoy themselves .Since is beginning in 1980,the Edmonton Folk Music Festival has been commemorating the true feeling of what folk music is all about and that's the traditional togetherness that is felt when people gather to share stories and feelings through song.\nThis year will be the sixth year when volunteer Riedel will be offering up her time to the festival. \"People coming off a busy spring and summer have a moment of relaxation.\" Riedel said. \"It's really easy to relax, and it's great seeing family and friends have fun together.\" These families and friends come from all different kinds of musical tastes. People who take pleasure in Blues are there, so aren't people who love Bluegrass. This festival does its best to develop everyone's musical interests.

If you walk around any large city, you'll find a coffee shop on every corner. Coffee shops offer a safe place for teenagers to hang out. As like anything else you let your children do, you need to set limits. Drinking coffee while socializing once or twice a week won't cause a severe caffeine addiction. However, you should avoid allowing a cup of coffee every morning and ensure they get adequate sleep each night, which will make them less likely to feel the need to drink coffee.\nAs parents, we have responsibility to set a good example. If you're addicted to caffeine, it's time to start monitoring your intake. If you drink much water and keep healthier drink options in your fridge and at your dinner table, your teenager will follow you. I drink much water and so don't both my children.
