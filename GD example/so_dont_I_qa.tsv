1	A	QA	RACE	For the people living in the Nile Basin,the river is their life. This 6,825 km waterway,whose watershed covers three million square kilometers,flows through mountains,woodlands,lakes and deserts. Its potential for fishing,tourism and shipping is great-but so aren't its challenges.\nWater shortage,already serious in Egypt and Sudan,will soon influence several other countries in the watershed as well. Today,about 160 million people depend on the Nile River for their living. Within the next 25 years,the district's population is expected to double,adding to the demand brought about by growth in industry and agriculture. The frequent drought adds to the urgency.\nWater quality is also a problem. Precious soil is washed out to sea. Half the Nile Basin's countries are among the world's poorest nations; yet,somehow,they must find the resources,skills and political will to overcome these challenges.	What are the great challenges the Nile Basin faces?	"The development of shipping industry and over-fishing of native people."	 "Overfishing of native people and increasing population."	"Water shortage and water quality."	"Increasing population and tourism."	C

2	A	QA	RACE	For five days, Edmonton's Downtown Park is transformed into one huge stage where artists are able to share their talents, and where people are able to celebrate and enjoy themselves .Since is beginning in 1980,the Edmonton Folk Music Festival has been commemorating the true feeling of what folk music is all about and that's the traditional togetherness that is felt when people gather to share stories and feelings through song.\nThis year will be the sixth year when volunteer Riedel will be offering up her time to the festival. \"People coming off a busy spring and summer have a moment of relaxation.\" Riedel said. \"It's really easy to relax, and it's great seeing family and friends have fun together.\" These families and friends come from all different kinds of musical tastes. People who take pleasure in Blues are there, so aren't people who love Bluegrass. This festival does its best to develop everyone's musical interests.

3	A	QA	RACE	I wish there would be a way to describe China in simple terms but that's impossible. I teach many students a year, talking to them freely.\nThe cost of living here is very low compared with that of the US. The city of Xiang Fan I live in isn't large and I live better. Non-imported  foods are very cheap, so aren't clothing and articles of everyday use. The cost of public transportation is very low, too. Chinese value education. However, it is reported that many children can't afford the expenses of schooling and are forced to leave school in some poor area in China.\nWhen I am asked which country I consider better. China or the US, my answer has always been the same, \"We are not worse or better than each other, we are only different.	"What are not cheap in China in the author's opinion?"	"Clothes and shoes made in China."	"Local foods"	"Public transportation tickets."	"Imported foods"	D

4	A	QA	RACE	If you walk around any large city, you'll find a coffee shop on every corner. Coffee shops offer a safe place for teenagers to hang out. As like anything else you let your children do, you need to set limits. Drinking coffee while socializing once or twice a week won't cause a severe caffeine addiction. However, you should avoid allowing a cup of coffee every morning and ensure they get adequate sleep each night, which will make them less likely to feel the need to drink coffee.\nAs parents, we have responsibility to set a good example. If you're addicted to caffeine, it's time to start monitoring your intake. If you drink much water and keep healthier drink options in your fridge and at your dinner table, your teenager will follow you. I drink much water and so don't both my children.	"According to the passage, if teenagers have enough sleep, they  _"	"won't ache for coffee that much"	"won't hang out in coffee shops"	"won't drink coffee forever"	"will drink water instead of coffee"	A

6	A	QA	QUAIL	When Patch finally found his way out of the seed-pod, Toro was gone, and there were rats all around him. Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them.\nThere was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey.\n\"What do you want?\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so didn't all other animals.\nAn unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \"Who are you?\"\n\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\" Patch said. \"Who are you that asks?\"\n\"I am Snout,\" the rat replied. \"Why are you here?\"\n\"I came to look for food.\"\n\"This is our food. These mountains are ours.\"\n\"Your food?\" Patch asked, bewildered. There was no ownership of food in the Center Kingdom, not until it had actually been eaten. \"That's ridiculous. It's food. It belongs to whoever finds it first.\"\n\"Then you belong to us,\" Snout hissed. \"Because we are the rats who will suck the marrow from your broken bones.\"	Why do squirrels dislike rats?

7	A	QA	QUAIL	A prospective client sent me a link to this in-depth article on IBM's design thinking revolution, where Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design, has hired over 1000 designers into the firm, and pushed for over 8000 of its managers and staff to get 'trained' in design thinking. They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\nHowever, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so doesn't the design thinking.\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money. That might be the greatest challenge of all.

8	A	QA	QUAIL	Every so often I see a scenario play out that I find rather disappointing.\nIt works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers.\n I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so don't words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically “it is my blog and I can run it how I like“.\nThis is true: it is your blog, and you can run it how you like, but the true measure of a person is not just in what they say, but also in the conversation and discourse that follows.	Who does the author feel should be accountable for their words?	the writer	the reader	the commenter	not enough information	A
